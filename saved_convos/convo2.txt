dev note: this one was interesting. so i added more user-assitant data from a group chat using writer.py,
but it didnt seem to help out that much. the bot actually talks more like normal gpt now. he also mentions the system
message i put in a lot, like the "tell jokes and make fun of things other people might say". i'm going to
delete most of those messages from the model because it doesn't look like it's doing any good
