dev note: what i did instead was re add lines 8-11 in him.py, where you create a chat completeion model but don't
access it, which seems like its important considering the difference it made. I kept the large user-assistant dataset and it talks
a lot like it, but i still don't really like this one as much as convo 1, even though textually it's more successful.
i'm going to go through the data and cherry pick what i need, cut the rest, and add some more phrases and it should work well.
then i'll make a bot with it instead of just using the terminal.
